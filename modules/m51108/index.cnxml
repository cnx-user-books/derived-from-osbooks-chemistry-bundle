<para id="fs-idp222368384">A chemical reaction is usually written in a way that suggests it proceeds in one direction, the direction in which we read, but all chemical reactions are reversible, and both the forward and reverse reaction occur to one degree or another depending on conditions. In a chemical <term>equilibrium</term>, the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, and the concentrations of products and reactants remain constant. If we run a reaction in a closed system so that the products cannot escape, we often find the reaction does not give a 100% yield of products. Instead, some reactants remain after the concentrations stop changing. At this point, when there is no further change in concentrations of reactants and products, we say the reaction is at equilibrium. A mixture of reactants and products is found at equilibrium.</para>

<para id="fs-idp53505568">The formation of NO<sub>2</sub> from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a <term>reversible reaction</term>, which is identified by the equilibrium arrow <m:math><m:mtext>(⇌)</m:mtext></m:math>. All reactions are reversible, but many reactions, for all practical purposes, proceed in one direction until the reactants are exhausted and will reverse only under certain conditions. Such reactions are often depicted with a one-way arrow from reactants to products. Many other reactions, such as the formation of NO<sub>2</sub> from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, are reversible under more easily obtainable conditions and, therefore, are named as such. In a reversible reaction, the reactants can combine to form products and the products can react to form the reactants. Thus, not only can N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> decompose to form NO<sub>2</sub>, but the NO<sub>2</sub> produced can react to form N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. As soon as the forward reaction produces any NO<sub>2</sub>, the reverse reaction begins and NO<sub>2</sub> starts to react to form N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. At equilibrium, the concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> no longer change because the rate of formation of NO<sub>2</sub> is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of NO<sub>2</sub>, and the rate of formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. <emphasis effect="italics">Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process</emphasis>: As with the swimmers and the sunbathers, the numbers of each remain constant, yet there is a flux back and forth between them (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_13_01_dynamic"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idp238607728">In a chemical equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions do not stop, rather they continue to occur at the same rate, leading to constant concentrations of the reactants and the products.

<para id="fs-idp58384928">We can detect a state of equilibrium because the concentrations of reactants and products do not appear to change.

<title>Equilibrium and Soft Drinks</title>
<para id="fs-idp391112032">The connection between chemistry and carbonated soft drinks goes back to 1767, when Joseph Priestley (1733–1804; mostly known today for his role in the discovery and identification of oxygen) discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water. In 1772, Priestly published a paper entitled “Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.” The paper describes dripping oil of vitriol (today we call this sulfuric acid, but what a great way to describe sulfuric acid: “oil of vitriol” literally means “liquid nastiness”) onto chalk (calcium carbonate). The resulting CO<sub>2</sub> falls into the container of water beneath the vessel in which the initial reaction takes place; agitation helps the gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> mix into the liquid water.</para>

<para id="fs-idp30588816">Today, CO<sub>2</sub> can be pressurized into soft drinks, establishing the equilibrium shown above. Once you open the beverage container, however, a cascade of equilibrium shifts occurs. First, the CO<sub>2</sub> gas in the air space on top of the bottle escapes, causing the equilibrium between gas-phase CO<sub>2</sub> and dissolved or aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> to shift, lowering the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the soft drink. Less CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the liquid leads to carbonic acid decomposing to dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The lowered carbonic acid concentration causes a shift of the final equilibrium. As long as the soft drink is in an open container, the CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles up out of the beverage, releasing the gas into the air (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_13_01_SuperSat"/>). With the lid off the bottle, the CO<sub>2</sub> reactions are no longer at equilibrium and will continue until no more of the reactants remain. This results in a soft drink with a much lowered CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, often referred to as “flat.”</para>

When we pour liquid bromine into an empty bottle in which there is no bromine vapor, some liquid evaporates, the amount of liquid decreases, and the amount of vapor increases. If we cap the bottle so no vapor escapes, the amount of liquid and vapor will eventually stop changing and an equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor will be established.
