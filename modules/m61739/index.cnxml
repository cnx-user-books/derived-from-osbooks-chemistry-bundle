<para id="fs-idm156474800">We have seen that the rate of many reactions can be accelerated by catalysts. A catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy; in addition, the catalyst is regenerated in the process. Several reactions that are energetically favorable in the absence of a catalyst only occur at a reasonable rate when a catalyst is present. One example is hydrogenation, a process used in food industries to convert unsaturated fats to saturated fats. A comparison of the reaction coordinate diagrams (also known as energy diagrams) for catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydrogenation of a simple hydrocarbon molecule is shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_12_07_Hydrogenat"/>.

<title>Catalysts Do Not Affect Equilibrium</title>
<para id="fs-idp105247296">A catalyst can speed up the rate of a reaction.

<title>Fritz Haber</title>
<para id="fs-idp77012800">In the early 20th century, German chemist Fritz Haber (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_13_03_FritzHaber"/>) developed a practical process for converting diatomic nitrogen, which cannot be used by plants as a nutrient, to ammonia, a form of nitrogen that is easiest for plants to absorb.</para>

<para id="fs-idm3877312">The availability of nitrogen is a strong limiting factor to the growth of plants. Despite accounting for 78% of air, diatomic nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is nutritionally unavailable due the tremendous stability of the nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. For plants to use atmospheric nitrogen, the nitrogen must be converted to a more bioavailable form (this conversion is called nitrogen fixation).</para>
<para id="fs-idp196129664">Haber was born in Breslau, Prussia (presently Wroclaw, Poland) in December 1868. He went on to study chemistry and, while at the University of Karlsruhe, he developed what would later be known as the Haber process: the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under high temperatures and pressures. For this work, Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for synthesis of ammonia from its elements. The Haber process was a boon to agriculture, as it allowed the production of fertilizers to no longer be dependent on mined feed stocks such as sodium nitrate. Currently, the annual production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers exceeds 100 million tons and synthetic fertilizer production has increased the number of humans that arable land can support from 1.9 persons per hectare in 1908 to 4.3 in 2008.</para>

<para id="fs-idp43327440">In addition to his work in ammonia production, Haber is also remembered by history as one of the fathers of chemical warfare. During World War I, he played a major role in the development of poisonous gases used for trench warfare. Regarding his role in these developments, Haber said, “During peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country.”<footnote id="fs-idp3083296">Herrlich, P. “The Responsibility of the Scientist: What Can History Teach Us About How Scientists Should Handle Research That Has the Potential to Create Harm?” <emphasis effect="italics">EMBO Reports</emphasis> 14 (2013): 759–764.</footnote> Haber defended the use of gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane, saying that death was death, by whatever means it was inflicted. He stands as an example of the ethical dilemmas that face scientists in times of war and the double-edged nature of the sword of science.</para>
<para id="fs-idm25838944">Like Haber, the products made from ammonia can be multifaceted. In addition to their value for agriculture, nitrogen compounds can also be used to achieve destructive ends. Ammonium nitrate has also been used in explosives, including improvised explosive devices. Ammonium nitrate was one of the components of the bomb used in the attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.</para>

<para id="fs-idm241568976">Catalysts function by providing an alternate reaction mechanism that has a lower activation energy than would be found in the absence of the catalyst. In some cases, the catalyzed mechanism may include additional steps, as depicted in the reaction diagrams shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_12_07_CatReCoDig"/>.

A catalyst does not affect the energy of reactant or product, so those aspects of the diagrams can be ignored; they are, as we would expect, identical in that respect. There is, however, a noticeable difference in the transition state, which is distinctly lower in diagram (b) than it is in (a). This indicates the use of a catalyst in diagram (b). The activation energy is the difference between the energy of the starting reagents and the transition state—a maximum on the reaction coordinate diagram. The reagents are at 6 kJ and the transition state is at 20 kJ, so the activation energy can be calculated as follows:</para>

<para id="fs-idm242073328">In 1974, Molina and Rowland published a paper in the journal <emphasis effect="italics">Nature</emphasis> (one of the major peer-reviewed publications in the field of science) detailing the threat of chlorofluorocarbon gases to the stability of the ozone layer in earth’s upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects earth from solar radiation by absorbing ultraviolet light. As chemical reactions deplete the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere, a measurable “hole” forms above Antarctica, and an increase in the amount of solar ultraviolet radiation— strongly linked to the prevalence of skin cancers—reaches earth’s surface. The work of Molina and Rowland was instrumental in the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987 that successfully began phasing out production of chemicals linked to ozone destruction.</para>
<para id="fs-idm4297296">Molina and Rowland demonstrated that chlorine atoms from human-made chemicals can catalyze ozone destruction in a process similar to that by which NO accelerates the depletion of ozone. Chlorine atoms are generated when chlorocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons—once widely used as refrigerants and propellants—are photochemically decomposed by ultraviolet light or react with hydroxyl radicals. A sample mechanism is shown here using methyl chloride:</para>

<para id="fs-idm189720768">Enzyme molecules possess an active site, a part of the molecule with a shape that allows it to bond to a specific substrate (a reactant molecule), forming an enzyme-substrate complex as a reaction intermediate. There are two models that attempt to explain how this active site works. The most simplistic model is referred to as the lock-and-key hypothesis, which suggests that the molecular shapes of the active site and substrate are complementary, fitting together like a key in a lock. The induced fit hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the enzyme molecule is flexible and changes shape to accommodate a bond with the substrate. This is not to suggest that an enzyme’s active site is completely malleable, however. Both the lock-and-key model and the induced fit model account for the fact that enzymes can only bind with specific substrates, since in general a particular enzyme only catalyzes a particular reaction (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_12_07_Enzyme"/>).</para>

<equation id="eip-id1169898673415"><m:math><m:msub><m:mtext>Rate</m:mtext><m:mi>f</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msub><m:mtext>Rate</m:mtext><m:mi>r</m:mi></m:msub><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>so</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mi>k</m:mi><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mo>)</m:mo><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>k</m:mi><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mi>r</m:mi><m:mo>)</m:mo><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo></m:math></equation>
Also recall that the equilibrium constant is simply the ratio of product to reactant concentration at equilibrium:
<equation id="eip-id1165535766953"><m:math><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:mi>k</m:mi><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>k</m:mi><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mi>r</m:mi><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mfrac><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:math></equation><equation id="eip-id1165538765440"><m:math><m:mi>K</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>[</m:mo><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mo>]</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:math></equation></para><para id="eip-527">So the equilibrium constant turns out to be the ratio of the forward to the reverse rate constants.
This relationship also helps cement our understanding of the nature of a catalyst. That is, a catalyst does not change the fundamental equilibrium (or the underlying thermodynamics) of a reaction. Rather, what it does is alter the rate constant for the reaction – that is, both rate constants, forward and reverse, equally. In doing so, catalysts usually speed up the rate at which reactions attain equilibrium (though they can be used to slow down the rate of reaction as well!).
